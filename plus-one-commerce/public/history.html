            <h2>The History of Trade and Commerce</h2>
            <p class="introduction">
                Commerce didn't start with modern markets; its roots lie in ancient forms of exchange, primarily through the barter system, before the introduction of metallic currency.

                <h3>1. Barter System and Early Exchange</h3>
                <p>
                    Before money existed, trade was conducted by exchanging goods and services directly. This required a "double coincidence of wants"—both parties needed what the other offered. This system, while simple, limited the scale and efficiency of early commerce.

                <h3>2. Rise of the Guilds and Merchant Corporations</h3>
                <p>
                    During the medieval period, guilds emerged to regulate trade, set standards for craftsmanship, and protect local merchants. These organizations were precursors to modern corporations, establishing early forms of business ethics and quality control.

                <p>
                    The rise of banking in Renaissance Italy provided the necessary infrastructure (credit, bookkeeping) to support large-scale international trade routes, greatly expanding the reach of commercial activities.

                <h3>3. The Industrial Revolution (18th-19th Century)</h3>
                <p>
                    The introduction of steam power and mechanized production dramatically shifted the nature of commerce. Trade volumes exploded, and the factory system replaced the artisan model. This era gave rise to modern concepts of mass production, marketing, and the joint-stock company.
